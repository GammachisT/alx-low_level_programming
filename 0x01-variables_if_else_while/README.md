### 0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while
**Language:** C  
**Weight:** 1  
**Project Duration:** Dec 15, 2023, 6:00 AM to Dec 16, 2023, 6:00 AM  
**Auto Review:** Launched at the deadline

### In a Nutshell
- **Auto QA Review:** 70.0/70 mandatory & 21.0/21 optional
- **Overall Score:** 200.0%
  - **Mandatory:** 100.0%
  - **Optional:** 100.0%
- **Calculation:** 100.0% + (100.0% * 100.0%) == 200.0%

- Usage of if, if ... else statements
- How to declare variables of types `char`, `int`, and `unsigned int`
- How to assign values and print them using `printf`
- How to use the `while` loop
- Understanding the ASCII character set
- Purpose of `gcc` flags `-m32` and `-m64`


### Tasks
1. **Positive Anything is Better Than Negative Nothing**  
   A program that assigns a random number to `n` and prints whether it is positive, negative, or zero.

2. **The Last Digit**  
   A program that prints the last digit of `n` and determines its value in relation to 0 and 5.

3. **I Sometimes Suffer from Insomnia**  
   Print the alphabet in lowercase using only the `putchar` function.

4. **alphABET**  
   Print the alphabet in lowercase and uppercase using limited `putchar` calls.

5. **When I Was Having That Alphabet Soup**  
   Print the alphabet in lowercase, excluding 'q' and 'e'.

6. **Numbers**  
   Print all single-digit numbers from 0 to 9.

7. **Numberz**  
   Print all single-digit numbers without using `char` type variables.

8. **Smile in the Mirror**  
   Print the lowercase alphabet in reverse order.

9. **Hexadecimal**  
   Print all numbers of base 16 in lowercase.

10. **Patience, Persistence and Perspiration**
